# Web Design Lab: Tetris Game

## Project Description

This laboratory exercise for the Web Design course (13S112VD) for the academic year 2023/24 involves creating a "Tetris" game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript technologies.

## Game Rules

In "Tetris," the player uses keys to move blocks falling from the top of the playing area, aiming to arrange them so that there is as little empty space as possible. When a row is completely filled, it disappears, and all the blocks above it move down one level, earning the player points. As the game progresses, the blocks fall faster, giving the player less time to think and arrange. The game ends when the blocks stack up to the top of the playing area, preventing new blocks from appearing. 

### Key Features:

1. **Start Page**:
   - Displays detailed user instructions for playing the game.
   - Game settings panel where the user can select the types of blocks and difficulty level (easy, medium, hard). The difficulty level affects the initial speed of the falling blocks.

2. **Game Page**:
   - Shows the playing field where blocks fall.
   - Displays the current score, game level, and the next block type.
   - The player can move the block left or right, drop it faster, or rotate it.
   - When a block lands at the bottom or on another block, it stops, and a new block is generated at the top.
   - After the game ends, the player can save their score and name, then proceed to the results page.

3. **Results Page**:
   - Displays the names and scores of the top five games.
   - Shows the name and score from the previous game.
   - Provides a link back to the start page.
